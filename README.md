# **Pizza Sales Analysis Project**
Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project! This repository hosts an in-depth exploration of pizza sales data, employing the powerful synergy of POWER BI and SQL. Through SQL, we've imported and managed the data from SQL Server, and with the magic of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), we've transformed this raw data into actionable insights. The final touch comes with interactive dashboards created using POWER BI, making data visualization and exploration an engaging experience.

## **Introduction**
Pizza is not just a favorite food; it's a window into consumer preferences, trends, and behaviors. This project takes a deep dive into the world of pizza sales, offering a comprehensive analysis that benefits data enthusiasts, business owners, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of pizza consumption.

## **Key Features**
### **SQL Data Handling:** 
This project demonstrates effective data extraction, transformation, and management using SQL. I've utilized SQL Server to import and organize the pizza sales data.

### **DAX Transformations:** 
DAX comes into play as I manipulate the data to generate meaningful insights. Calculated columns, measures, and more are employed to derive important metrics.

### **Interactive POWER BI Dashboards:** 
I've harnessed the capabilities of POWER BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. These dashboards offer dynamic views into sales trends, customer behavior, and regional preferences.

### **Sales Insights:** 
Discover peak sales hours, popular pizza choices, and even customer segmentation insights through a variety of charts and graphs.

## **How to Use**
### **Setup SQL Server:** 
If you're interested in replicating this analysis, ensure you have access to a SQL Server instance. Import the provided pizza sales dataset. Or you can directly import the csv file.

### **SQL Data Extraction:** 
Use SQL queries to extract the necessary data from the SQL Server database.

### **DAX Transformations:** 
Employ DAX expressions to transform and enrich the data. This might involve creating calculated columns, defining measures, and performing complex calculations.

### **POWER BI Visualization:** 
Import the transformed data into POWER BI and start creating interactive dashboards. Leverage POWER BI's visualization tools to craft informative charts and graphs.

### **Exploration:**
Use the generated dashboards to explore different aspects of pizza sales. Slice and dice the data to gain insights that interest you.
